# Software Development Automated Pipeline
The objective of this project is setting up an automated pipeline for testing, building and delivering software. It uses a simple Web/API frontend/backend project to make use of:
 * Gitflow branching strategy using: main <- dev <- frontend/backend branches
 * Unit and Integration testing using pytest
 * CD/CI using GitHub actions
 * Static and Component Code Analysis using Snyk (https://snyk.io/)
 * Deployment of the product using Railway (https://railway.com/)
